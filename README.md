Downscaling vertical GPS observations to derive watershed-scale hydrologic loading in the Northern Rockies

GPS data from UNR Nevada Geodetic Labratory (http://geodesy.unr.edu/links.php). 

UNAVCO and Idaho Geodetic Lab maintain and service the stations and all raw observations are also available on the UNAVCO archive (unavco.org/data) but we used the UNR NGL solutions.  

All GRACE data is publicly available on (https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/) but were too big to put on GITHUB.

SNOTEL data is available on (https://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/snow/).
