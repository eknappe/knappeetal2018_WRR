Downscaling vertical GPS observations to derive watershed-scale hydrologic loading in the Northern Rockies

GPS data from UNR NGL (http://geodesy.unr.edu/links.php). UNAVCO and Idaho Geodetic Lab maintain and service the station but all raw 
observations are also available on the UNAVCO archive (unavco.org). 

All GRACE data is publicly available on (https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/) but were too big to put on GITHUB.

SNOTEL data is available on (https://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/snow/).
